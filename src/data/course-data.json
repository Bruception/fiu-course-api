In addition, during this course the students will also receive general concepts relating to clinical laboratory medicine and regulatory organizations allied to the field of medicine and hospital oversight in a 2 hour lecture referred to as fundamentals of laboratory medicine, followed by a one hour practical in the classroom. The Infectious Disease component includes an overview of microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, important to human disease and disease processes. Specific topic areas of this component of the course include microbial disease, virulence mechanisms, evasion strategies used by pathogens against the antimicrobial immune response, and innate antimicrobial mechanisms. General concepts (building blocks for comprehending organ-specific pathology presented in Period 2) are emphasized in this introductory course.
